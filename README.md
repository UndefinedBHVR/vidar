# Vidar

Vidar is a work-in-progress first-person shooter (FPS) game built with the Bevy game engine.

## Current Status

Vidar is in early development. I hope to leave this as an open source template for the community to use for research and design in their own projects.

## Getting Started

To run the current build of Vidar:

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `cargo run` in the project directory.

## Contributing

I welcome any and all contributions! Please make a PR or Issue if you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback.
